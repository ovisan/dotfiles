# Platform Availability

Which features work on which provider platform. **This table is the single source of truth in this skill** — per-feature sections elsewhere point here instead of restating availability. When writing code for a third-party platform (Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry) or Claude Platform on AWS, check this table first; a feature not supported there means use the first-party Claude API surface or a different approach.

Columns: **1P** = first-party Claude API, **P-AWS** = Claude Platform on AWS (Anthropic-operated, same-day parity), **Bedrock** = Amazon Bedrock, **Vertex** = Google Cloud Vertex AI, **Foundry** = Microsoft Foundry. ✅ = GA, β = beta, ❌ = not supported.
