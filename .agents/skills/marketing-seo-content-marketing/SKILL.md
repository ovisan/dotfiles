# Strategies: Content Marketing

Guides content marketing strategy across channels: content types, formats, distribution, and repurposing. 62% of successful B2B have a documented strategy; content repurposing addresses the top challenge—consistently developing new content. Use this skill when planning content across blog, email, social, video, and pages.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Scope

- **Content types**: What you create (by purpose/theme)
- **Content formats**: How it's delivered (article, video, email, post)
- **Channels**: Where it's distributed (blog, email, X, LinkedIn, etc.)
- **Repurposing**: One core content → multiple formats → multiple channels
- **Funnel mapping**: Content by stage (awareness, consideration, decision)

## Initial Assessment

**Check for project context first:** If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read Sections 3 (Value Proposition), 4 (Audience), 11 (Content Strategy).

Identify:
1. **Goals**: Traffic, conversions, brand, retention
2. **Existing content**: What already exists; audit gaps
3. **Capacity**: Resources, tools, cadence
4. **Channels**: Blog, email, social, video; which channels fit audience

## Content Repurposing Matrix

**Principle**: One core content → multiple formats → multiple channels. Maximize ROI.

| Core Content | Formats | Channels |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Case study** | Article, video, infographic, slides | Blog, email, LinkedIn, YouTube, sales deck |
| **How-to guide** | Article, video, checklist, PDF | Blog, email, YouTube, docs |
| **Product update** | Article, email, post, video | Blog, email, X, LinkedIn, changelog |
| **Industry insight** | Article, podcast, post, newsletter | Blog, Spotify, X, email |

**Example**: One client success story → article (blog) + video (YouTube) + infographic (LinkedIn) + slides (sales) → 4 channels from 1 creation.

## Funnel Mapping

| Stage | Content Focus | Channels |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Awareness** | Education, thought leadership, glossary, how-tos | Blog, SEO, social, PR |
| **Consideration** | Comparisons, case studies, demos, features | Blog, email, landing, social |
| **Decision** | Pricing, testimonials, product pages, case studies | Website, email, sales |
| **Retention** | Onboarding, newsletter, product updates, changelog | Email, in-app, blog |

## Article Orientations

Article types by orientation—drives structure, SEO depth, and schema choice. See **article-page-generator** for page structure.

| Orientation | Examples | Primary Goal | SEO Priority |
|-------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Funding / PR** | Funding rounds, acquisitions, executive hires | Brand awareness, press, investor relations | Low — thin content, few search queries |
| **Product updates** | Feature launches, release notes, changelogs | User education, product adoption | Low–medium — internal announcements rarely rank |
| **Guides / How-to** | Tutorials, step-by-step, best practices | Education, lead nurture, authority | High — matches search intent |
| **News / Trending** | Industry news, hot topics, seasonal | Engagement, social shares, topical relevance | Medium — quick traffic spikes, short shelf life |
| **Evergreen** | Pillar guides, glossaries, comparisons | Long-term traffic, backlinks, authority | High — compounds over time |

**SEO-driven vs non-SEO-driven**: SEO-driven (how-to, listicles, comparisons) → target keywords, full optimization. Non-SEO-driven (funding, product updates) → focus on clarity, shareability, internal linking to SEO content. Hybrid: product launch posts can include SEO-friendly sections (e.g., "How to use [feature]").

## Evergreen vs Timely Mix

| Mix | Ratio | Use |
|-----|-------|-----|
| **Evergreen** | 70–75% | Pillar guides, how-tos, comparisons, glossaries; long-term traffic; refresh 6–12 months |
| **Timely** | 25–30% | Seasonal, trending, news; quick spikes; link into evergreen pillars |

**Evergreen vs timely (article-level)**: Evergreen = year-round relevance; steady traffic; refresh every 6–12 months. Timely = weeks to months; spikes then decline; often one-and-done; use NewsArticle schema. Recommended mix: 70/30 or 60/40 evergreen-to-timely.

See **content-strategy** for SEO topic clusters and pillar-cluster structure.

## Content Calendar

- Map content types to topics and keywords
- Prioritize by opportunity (volume → intent → feasibility)
- Schedule by capacity; include update schedule for existing content
- Plan repurposing: which core pieces become formats for which channels
- **Visual-first**: Plan images in calendar from the start; see **visual-content** for specs and repurposing

## Output Format

- **Content types** plan (what to create)
- **Format × channel** matrix (how and where)
- **Repurposing** plan (one-to-many)
- **Funnel** mapping (awareness/consideration/decision)
- **Content calendar** (topics, keywords, deadlines, repurposing)
